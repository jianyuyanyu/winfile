# ![icon](winfile.png) Windows File Manager (WinFile)

The Windows File Manager lives again and runs as a native x86, x64 and arm64 desktop app
on all currently supported version of Windows, including Windows 11. I welcome your thoughts, comments and suggestions.

This current master was forked off from [microsoft/winfile](https://github.com/microsoft/winfile) and contains changes/additions to WinFile over the years by many contributors. Furthermore it contains additions which I think are usefull or bug fixes.

I will consider bugs fixes and suggestions for minor changes to the master branch. Feel free to create a pull request or post issues as you see fit.
